# strings are sequence of charectors , using either a single or double quotes
# strings are ordered squences , means we can use indexing and slicing to grab subsections of the strings
# Indexing notation uses [] , grab single charector of strings
# string  : h e l l 0
# index   : 0 1 2 3 4

# reverse indexing
# string : h e l l o
# index  : 0 1 2 3 4
# reverse: 0 -4 -3 -2 -1      # so last charector will always be -1

# slicing
# uses []    [start:stop:step]

#start is the numerical index for the start of the slice
# stop is the insec you will got up to, but not include
# stop is the size of the jump you take

word="hello"
word2="this is also a string"
